### A little about me
In April 2022, I met with a friend whom I hadn't seen for 10 years, it turned out that he works as a programmer and he loves his job very much, he said - "Man, I would do it for free, but I have to work for $ 9,000 a month!". It made a strong impression on me, because my work brought me pain and depression, to be honest, I didn't want to do it so much that money no longer mattered. I found out that his girlfriend is also a very cool programmer and asked - "It looks like your seed has great IT power, if I suck your dick, will I become a programmer?", he replied - "There is no need for this - Frontend, brother, this is the easiest way to become a programmer", we laughed and I I went home, but this conversation haunted me for several days - "Damn, it looks like I'm not his type" - was spinning in my head, and then I put these thoughts aside and started looking for information on programming training - how?, where?, how much does it cost?

Since then, I have firmly decided to become a programmer and swore that I would not get a haircut until I became a Frontend developer, now I am so overgrown that I look like a toilet brush, so that's my goal... Finally get a haircut. Well, and become a Frontend developer of course
